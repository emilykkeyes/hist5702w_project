By a spirituall power their eyes did manifestly see the water, and as apparently after see the blood, and the rod turned into a Serpent, the eye being a true and undeceived witnesse of both: Things imagined and fancied, are easily discerned from those things that are reall and true objects. But it may be demanded, whether a Spirit or Devil can cause such a transmutation of the bodies of Witches into those severall shapes and forms of Cats, 
<LOCATION>Dogges</LOCATION>, Birds, and other creatures, as is often reported, where Witches and Sorcerers have lived. The answer is, that it is impossible in nature, and in the ordinary unchangeable course of all things created by god, that one individuall and continued substance or entire thing should be wholly divided from it self, and yet be it self, G1 for there can be nor all or true transmutation of one substance, or nature into a other, but either by creation or generation.
