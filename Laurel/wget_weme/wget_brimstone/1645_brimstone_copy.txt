Several apparitions appear to him of men from the army who have been sent to Hell, in particular, Sir Peter Ball, "one of the commissioners of Excester lately deceased."  Sir Peter Ball is "lying all along after a strange manner, his Legs and Feet schorching in furious flames, his Buttockes upon a Crediton, his Backe and Shoulders in a frying pan, his Head in a boyling kettle of pitch."  Sir Peter Ball is also cursing, and being accused of "extorting, coveteousnesse, and cheating of the Country."(4)</p>

  <td><p>Joseph Buxford is found by two labourers in a hedge after he has been expelled from Hell, who take him "home to there Masters house," where is given clothing, a warm bed and "some nourishing broth."  He is so revived by this, that he confesses "unto them his name, birth-place, and his strange journey with the Devill."  At first, this seemed ridiculous to the justice, but after consideration was made for the manner in which he was found, and confirmation of his father in the "manner of his departure," it is concluded he is telling the truth.(4)</p>

The minister gives the boy "pious admonitions of obedience," and listened to Joseph Buxford's testimonies of penitence "of his former lewd courses," and his reconciliation with his father, "with whom he now liveth and is almost cured of that distortion of his members."
